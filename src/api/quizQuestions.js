      question: "Nandita and Vajresh are looking for ways to make more money without having to work another job. Which option will provide them the most income? In other words, which option will generate the most amount of money, without putting in a lot of work?",
      answers: [
        {
        option: "Each applying for a new credit card",
        desc: "Nandita and Vajresh each apply for a new credit card. Congrats, they both got approved! However, it is important to remember that credit cards do not generate money. In fact, Nandita and Vajresh might end up losing more money because they would be spending money with a credit card that they don’t actually have to pay back- doing the opposite of their original goal. For more reliable and consistent income, the best option here is investing in long-term stock. Long-term stocks are usually also low risk and don’t require much maintenance. This means that it is highly likely that the stock will continue to rise in price, just slowly. Regardless, the Cruz family’s income will rise, and it is likely that they will be paid in cash eventually. Therefore, this is the best option.",
